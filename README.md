# Homepage
===
My first attempt of a small homepage w/ name and recent jobs.

## Distribution:
Build and deploy with
```bash
npm run build
```
This automatically builds the project. It also deletes all files on the server provided in `auth/user_hostname.txt` and uploads the new one. Note that this file is not provided in the repository for privacy reasons.

## Next Steps:
- move Favicon slightly towards the bottom
- (major) Replace the "Meine Referenzen" button with a big scrollable landing page
