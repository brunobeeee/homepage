# Homepage
My first attempt of a small homepage w/ name and recent jobs...

## Next Steps:
- Align the 3 cards at cv.html to the center when in xxl breakpoint. (maybe min-vh-100 helps?)
- Avoid horizontal scroll on index.html
- Add fallback font for Linux/Windows(?) machines, that dont have Avenir installed.
- (major) Maybe replace the "Meine Referenzen" button with a big scrollable landing page

## Reminders:
- build with "npm run build"
